&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Some experts in the nascent blockchain industry have said the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blockchain is just a database&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blockchains don’t help with fast settlement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future of finance on the blockchain may not involve consensus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can build on top of the Bitcoin blockchain for fast settlement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short post will address these statements and paint a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-source-of-bitcoin-s-security:c70e654fcbeba9e734c64c9df590bef4&#34;&gt;The source of Bitcoin’s security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining, or Nakamoto consensus, provides something that until 2008 had never existed before.  Bitcoin was the first open decentralized application to provide Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus on a global currency ledger.  Nakamoto consensus is a novel BFT consensus algorithm that utilizes computational power as a proxy for membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security of Nakamoto consensus depends on extrinsic factors such as the availability of energy and access to semiconductor fabs.  Ignoring these factors, the security of Nakamoto consensus can be modeled by the makeup and diversity of the mining network.  The more diverse the mining participants, the more difficult it is to coordinate a sufficiently large coalition to successfully attack the network and cause double-spends. If we discount the difficulty of coordination (which may be prudent considering that major mining pools communicate with each other routinely), what’s left is the opportunity cost of producing blockchain forks&amp;ndash;just 25 bitcoins per block at today’s inflationary reward schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin blockchain does help with settlement in that it provides a BFT ledger.  The problem is that Nakamoto consensus is slow and expensive, as its security is only proportional to the cumulative sum of energy burned over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;classical-bft-collateral-is-new:c70e654fcbeba9e734c64c9df590bef4&#34;&gt;Classical BFT + collateral is new&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical BFT consensus algorithms don’t rely on the opportunity cost of energy expenditure for security.  They use pseudonymous identities and cryptographic signatures to ensure that a sufficient quorum of participants approve of new transactions before they are committed.  These algorithms had been around since the 70’s and 80’s, and culminated in 1999 with the renowned PBFT algorithm.  Existing PBFT solutions are difficult to use or incomplete (&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4854&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), so there is a need for a new free and open-source implementation.  Tendermint is such an open-source implementation of the PBFT consensus protocol (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-vs-pbft/&#34;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;).  Tendermint can commit blocks to finality on a global ledger with hundreds of validators on the order of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Nakamoto consensus, there is no extrinsic opportunity cost for signing conflicting blocks on the blockchain, since cryptographic signatures are practically free. Instead, we can design classical BFT consensus protocols to be &lt;em&gt;accountable&lt;/em&gt;; that is, when the blockchain is forked, we can review the signatures and determine which participants caused the fork to happen&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  If we combine this BFT accountability with the concept of collateral, we get something that I’m calling &lt;em&gt;additive-collateral&lt;/em&gt;.  Each individual participant of the BFT consensus process might only post a small amount of collateral (limited by their confidence in ability to secure their hardware and software), but the total total effective collateral can be large.  For example, if there are 1000 validators that each post $1M worth of collateral, a double-spend attack would cost attackers at minimum $333M dollars ($1M * 1000 * ⅓).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consortium of banks could run a Tendermint blockchain where the validators are publicly identified.  Each validator can post collateral secured by legal contracts with real assets held in escrow by each other, and/or with tokens intrinsic to the blockchain.  Each validator on such a blockchain network would secure their public/private key to the best of their ability.  To mitigate the risk of accidents and hacks, each validator keypair can be derived from multiple keypairs that produce signatures jointly using a cryptographic threshold signature scheme;  in effect, each validator node would be running a BGA consensus network recursively for additional security.  Tendermint validators uses the Ed25519 Schnorr signature scheme because it supports cryptographic threshold signatures (&lt;a href=&#34;http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2001/corr2001-13.ps&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fin:c70e654fcbeba9e734c64c9df590bef4&#34;&gt;Fin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With publicly identified Tendermint validators with collateral at risk, we can have a shared decentralized ledger that offers fast settlement.  This is a novel concept and one that has the potential to change the nature of banking itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Accountability in BFT consensus algorithms is not something that I have encountered yet in literature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
